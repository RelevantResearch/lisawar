I have also devoted time to pro bono or volunteer work throughout my legal career. I currently assist TRLA with several pro bono divorce cases and have assisted private individuals on a “low” bono basis as well. I have also volunteered with organizations assisting asylum seekers and refugees on both sides of the border including Al Otro Lado, Pueblo Sin Fronteras, Women’s Refugee Commission, Texas Civil Rights Project, ACLU Border Rights Center, the RGV Equal Voice Network, and at the South Texas Family Residential Detention Center. I have also conducted presentations and other forms of public education on worker’s rights and immigration with LUPE, ARISE, Equal Voice Network, Border Workers United, and have volunteered as an ESL tutor, and foster/transported cats and dogs. I have 5-7 cats and I love snowboarding.
