I also recently took a self-imposed sabbatical following the death of my brother, [Mark C. Guerra](https://www.fox4news.com/news/beloved-dallas-theater-teacher-killed-in-traffic-accident). Mark’s death moved me to measure my wealth in time and travel, so I have been working part-time on cases that I truly believe are worthwhile or where I can make a difference. I work solo, so please be patient if seeking my services or awaiting updates.

## Texas Legal Experience: 
Currently in my solo practice - Law Office of Lisa Y Guerra - and while in private practice, I handle all aspects of litigation, including trial, in employment law, civil rights, family law, business law, consumer law, torts, personal injury law, consumer law, and family law, and immigration law. I recently settled one case involving employment discrimination and FMLA claims against a multinational corporation and another case involving consumer law (DTPA) and  contract claims against a national manufacturer and local dealer in the transportation industry.  My immigration experience includes affirmative cancellation of removal assisted private attorneys on a contract basis with defensive and affirmative asylum and cancellation of removal cases. 

At Texas RioGrande Legal Aid (TRLA), I was a Staff Attorney on the Migrant Farmworker & Employment Law Teams predominantly representing local low-income and migrant agricultural workers - including H-2A agricultural guest workers - with a variety of employment law claims, usually in federal courts across the country including, but not limited to Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Wyoming, and Georgia. Lisa also assisted with the Disaster Relief, Income Tax, Immigration, and Consumer Law Teams at TRLA. While assisting asylum seekers in 2016-2018, I won a defensive asylum case for a detainee in Port Isabel.

At South Texas College (STC), I was the Institutional Equity Officer, including roles as Title IX  Coordinator & 504/ADA Coordinator where I handled complaints of discrimination from students, faculty, administrators, and contractors, from all areas of the school. As Title IX Coordinator, I was responsible for drafting, publishing, and implementing the newly published Title IX regulations issued just months after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in 2020, during a period of uncertainty. Due to the pandemic, I briefly advised STC administrators on the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), assisted with furloughs and layoffs, and worked remote or in-person as needed.

## Legal Experience in New York, DC and beyond: 
From 2012-2014, I lived in Bed Stuy Brooklyn and worked in Manhattan as an agency attorney for the Labor Bureau of the New York City Comptroller’s Office. I prosecuted wage claims for work performed on NYC construction and service contracts. I was involved with all aspects of litigation including damages assessments, client/witness interviews, asset research, discovery, settlement negotiations, pre-trial motion practice, trial prep, and bench trials before the NYC Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH). I also reviewed construction contracts, service contracts, real estate purchase lease agreements, real estate financing agreements, and collective bargaining agreements as part of my work. In just two years with the Labor Bureau, I recovered over $5 million dollars in unpaid wages, interest, and civil penalties. Lisa also assisted with the publication of New York City’s [annual prevailing wage schedules](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/services/for-the-public/nyc-wage-standards/wage-schedules/) based on surveys and reports from a wide variety of local unions.

From 2009-2012, I worked at the DC Employment Justice Center (EJC) as both a Wage & Hour Policy Attorney and Bilingual Litigation Attorney. In both positions, I focused on legal advocacy for immigrant low-wage workers who were victims of wage theft. As a policy attorney, I worked with worker rights organizations, national and local unions, and District Council members, to pass the [Workplace Fraud Amendment Act of 2012](https://lims.dccouncil.gov/downloads/LIMS/25925/Signed_Act/B19-0169-SignedAct.pdf) (which prohibits misclassification of construction workers as independent contractors) and the [Wage Theft Prevention Act of 2014](https://lims.dccouncil.gov/downloads/LIMS/31203/Signed_Act/B20-0671-SignedAct.pdf) -(which added variety of protections to the existing statute for victims of wage theft).  As a litigation attorney, I was responsible for all aspects of litigation of wage-hour cases in federal and state courts, including collective and class actions, at times with private co-counsel. I also assisted with the management and operation of EJC’s weekly Workers’ Rights Law Clinic which served workers from DC, Maryland, and Virginia.

From 2007-2009, I worked as document review attorney at a variety of “big law” firms including: Williams & Connolly; Arnold & Porter; Willkie, Farr & Gallagher; Hogan & Hartson; and Wiley, Rein & Fielding. I conducted English and Spanish review of documents in response to government agency subpoenas or as part of corporate self-audits, including reviews for privilege and confidentiality. During one highly-confidential project in 2009, I was the only attorney reviewing documents related to the 2008 financial crisis. 

After graduating from Vermont Law School in 2005, I was a Migrant Worker Staff Attorney with the Northwest Justice Project in Yakima, Washington from 2006-2007, representing migrant worker clients with employment law matters. Ion addition to assisting with litigation and outreach, I represented farmworker interests within a [Washington state pesticide biomonitoring program](https://doh.wa.gov/data-statistical-reports/environmental-health/biomonitoring) and in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stakeholder meetings on federal pesticide regulation.


## Volunteer Work:
I have also devoted time to pro bono or volunteer work throughout my legal career. I currently assist TRLA with several pro bono divorce cases and have assisted private individuals on a “low” bono basis as well. I have also volunteered with organizations assisting asylum seekers and refugees on both sides of the border including Al Otro Lado, Pueblo Sin Fronteras, Women’s Refugee Commission, Texas Civil Rights Project, ACLU Border Rights Center, the RGV Equal Voice Network, and at the South Texas Family Residential Detention Center. I have also conducted presentations and other forms of public education on worker’s rights and immigration with LUPE, ARISE, Equal Voice Network, Border Workers United, and have volunteered as an ESL tutor, and foster/transported cats and dogs. I have 5-7 cats and I love snowboarding.
