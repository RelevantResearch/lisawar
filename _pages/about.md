My name is Lisa Guerra but I go by Lisa “War”, since Guerra means ‘war’ in Spanish. 

I am a bilingual lawyer licensed in Texas, New York, and the District of Columbia. I run my own private practice law firm and am passionate about providing mediation services to help clients resolve difficult issues without the need for costly litigation. I bring nearly 20 years of experience across a wide variety of legal practice areas to my work as a mediator.

My interest in helping clients resolve matters productively through mediation emerged in part from a renewed recognition of the value of life. The recent passing of my brother, Mark C. Guerra, moved me to measure my wealth not in money, but in time and relationships. After a self-imposed sabbatical, I returned to my legal practice with a renewed purpose to focus on cases that I believe are truly worthwhile and where I believe I can make a difference.
